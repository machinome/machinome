## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A relation's law is compiled to an expression over coordinate ids

At construction under a running root the system SHALL COMPILE the
relations the rest render solved into a program over the bank: each
relation's law SHALL be applied ONCE to a symbolic token per source
coordinate, in the direction the rest render solved it, and the
expression graph that application builds — over the qualified ids of
the sources — SHALL be what the run evaluates on every tick and what
the refusals below inspect. A graph containing a DISCONTINUOUS
primitive — a call to `floor`, `ceil` or `sign`, the `%` operator, or a
comparison — SHALL additionally be compiled into a JUMP PLAN: its jump
nodes in the graph's postorder, each with the level quantity whose
surfaces it crosses, the graph of that level quantity with the jump
nodes inside it replaced by branch placeholders, whether that level
quantity is AFFINE in the sources, and the SKELETON of the whole
expression with every jump node so replaced. A wiring into a bank
coordinate SHALL be an
identity edge and a derived coordinate a linear edge. A relation or
wiring none of whose driven ends is, or reaches through such
intermediates, a bank coordinate SHALL be left to the ordinary
enumeration, and SHALL leave nothing of itself in the program: the
program's COORDINATES SHALL be the bank's, plus exactly the ends its
compiled edges read and give. An end of a relation left to the ordinary
enumeration SHALL NOT be a coordinate of the program, SHALL NOT be
published as one, and SHALL NOT be a reason to refuse the program — the
run never computes it, and the ordinary enumeration recomputes it from
the bank on every tick exactly as it does under no time base at all.
The program SHALL have an IDENTITY derived from the root
class, the bank's ids, the inputs' declarations and every edge's ends,
direction and expression.

The system SHALL refuse, at construction and by relation identity —
naming the relation as written and the class that stated it:

- a law that cannot be applied to symbols — one that raises when handed
  a symbolic token, returns something that is neither a number nor an
  expression, or whose expression holds text the framework cannot
  evaluate or a call outside the symbolic vocabulary — saying that a
  running law is an expression over its sources;
- a relation or wiring INTO a bank coordinate whose source is a
  coordinate the run does not own and no compiled edge computes — a
  plain port the author's `simulate()` binds — saying to state that
  value as a relation or a joint;
- a relation naming several driven ends of which some are bank
  coordinates and some are not;
- a law whose expression contains a DISCONTINUOUS primitive and none of
  whose driven ends is a coordinate the run owns — a plain port or a
  derived coordinate the ordinary enumeration recomputes from the bank
  on every tick — saying that a subtracted jump implies a history,
  that only a coordinate the run owns keeps one, and that the relation
  should be stated into the joint coordinate so the port follows it.

A law whose expression has no free coordinate — a constant — SHALL
compile and contribute a zero increment; a law that can move its
coordinate only by jumping SHALL be refused under the requirement "A
law that can only jump is refused as arithmetic".

#### Scenario: A running root with a floor in a law compiles

- **WHEN** a running root states `crank.drives(first.turn, law=window)`
  where the law's expression contains `floor(angle / 360)`
- **THEN** construction succeeds, the compiled graph names the source's
  qualified id, its jump plan holds one `floor` node whose level
  quantity is that qualified id divided by 360 and is AFFINE in the
  sources, and the same root without `Time.running()` poses exactly as
  before

#### Scenario: A jumping law into a plain port is refused

- **WHEN** a running root states `crank.drives(register, law=window)`
  where `register` is a plain port wired to a joint coordinate and the
  law's expression contains `floor`
- **THEN** construction is refused naming the relation and the port, and
  saying to state the relation into the joint coordinate the run owns;
  and the same relation stated into that joint coordinate compiles

#### Scenario: A law over stdlib math is refused as non-symbolic

- **WHEN** a running root's law computes `math.sin(angle)` from Python's
  standard library
- **THEN** construction is refused naming the relation and saying the law
  cannot be applied to symbols

#### Scenario: A relation sourced from an author-bound port is refused

- **WHEN** a running root's `simulate()` binds a plain port from its
  crank and a relation drives a joint from that port
- **THEN** construction is refused naming the relation and the port, and
  advising a relation or a joint

#### Scenario: A law with a kink compiles

- **WHEN** a running root's law is `4 + 72 * clamp01((angle − 113.5) / 11.25)`
- **THEN** construction succeeds and the compiled expression names the
  source's qualified id and only `min` and `max` among calls

#### Scenario: A relation the enumeration keeps leaves no coordinate in the program

- **WHEN** a running root drives the `height` port of its `.repeat()`
  children, and no relation carries those ports back to a joint
  coordinate
- **THEN** the compiled program's coordinates are the driver and the
  joint coordinates only, no copy's port is among them, the program's
  edges are unchanged, and the run poses every copy exactly as the same
  root without `Time.running()` does

#### Scenario: A part this render omits leaves no coordinate in the program

- **WHEN** a running root holds an optional part whose joint one of its
  drivers drives, and this render `omit()`s that part
- **THEN** the compiled program's coordinates are the driver and the
  joint coordinates of the parts that ARE in the machine, the omitted
  part's coordinate is not among them, and construction succeeds
