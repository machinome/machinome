## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: An assembly mates a child's frame onto another frame

The system SHALL let an assembly relate two frames in its class body with
the statement `<moving frame>.on(<fixed frame>, <freedom>)`, called a
**mate**. The frame that speaks is the one that MOVES. The statement
SHALL be recorded on the class being defined whether or not it is
assigned; assigning it, `elbow = art3.hinge.on(elbow_pin, Revolute())`,
SHALL name the mate. A mate SHALL be enumerable off the class, in
declaration order and without constructing an instance, by an enumerator
exported from `machinome.motion.mates`, and SHALL be inherited by a
subclass.

The MOVING end SHALL be a frame declared by a child the assembly declares
directly, written `<child>.<frame>`. The FIXED end SHALL be either a
frame the declaring assembly itself declares, written by its bare name in
the class body, or a frame declared by another child the assembly
declares directly, written `<child>.<frame>`.

The FREEDOM SHALL be a `Revolute`: `Revolute(range=(lo, hi), unit='deg')`.
It MAY also state the line the child turns about,
`Revolute(axis=(x, y, z), at=(x, y, z), range=..., unit=...)`, because a
design's connectors are ATTACHMENT frames and the line a part turns about
need not be the moving frame's `z` nor pass through its origin. A stated
`axis` and a stated `at` SHALL each be three numbers, read in the MOVING
CHILD's own rest frame — the frame the moving frame is declared in and a
joint the child's own class declares is read in — and nothing SHALL be
carried or inverted to read them. Each SHALL be independent of the
other: a freedom may state `axis` alone, `at` alone, both or neither,
and what it leaves out the moving frame supplies (see "A mate gives the
moving child a joint"). The freedom's `range` SHALL be omitted, a pair of
numbers, or a pair whose bounds are numbers, `None`, or functions of the
coordinate's own value.

The following SHALL be refused when the declaring class is created,
naming the class, the mate and the reason:

- a mate stated on a class that is not an `AssemblyNode`;
- a moving end that is the assembly's own frame, or that is not a frame,
  or whose frame is reached through more than one child;
- a fixed end reached through more than one child;
- a fixed end on a child that can move within the assembly — one whose
  class declares a joint, including one a mate or a declaration site
  gives it — because the moving child is placed against the fixed
  child's REST placement and would not follow it;
- either end on a child held in a list or declared with `.repeat()`;
- a second mate whose moving end is a frame of a child another mate
  already places, which is a loop;
- a mate that names a child the class — or, for an inherited mate, the
  subclass — no longer declares as the one the mate was written against;
- a mate with a freedom that is left unnamed, because its coordinate is
  named after the mate;
- a freedom that is not a `Revolute` — a `Prismatic`, an `Orbit` or a
  `Free` —, a freedom whose range is a callable of the node or reads
  other coordinates, or a freedom already declared on some class;
- a freedom whose stated `axis` or `at` is not three numbers — a
  parameter token, a formula, or a callable of the node, each of which
  would be resolved against the moving child although it is written in
  the assembly —, or whose stated `axis` has no length;
- a mate stated with no freedom, the rigid mate, which this version does
  not provide.

#### Scenario: Thor's elbow is one statement

- **WHEN** an upper-arm assembly declares
  `elbow_pin = Frame(at=(0, 160, 68), z=(0, 0, 1))` and the child
  `art3 = Art3()`, `Art3` declaring
  `hinge = Frame(at=(0, 0, 81.5), z=(0, 1, 0), x=(1, 0, 0))`, and states
  `elbow = art3.hinge.on(elbow_pin, Revolute(range=(-135, 135)))`
- **THEN** the class is created and reports one mate named `elbow`,
  moving `art3.hinge` onto `elbow_pin`

#### Scenario: A mate is refused outside an assembly

- **WHEN** a leaf part's class body states a mate
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming the class and saying a mate
  is stated on the assembly that holds both frames

#### Scenario: The moving end must be a child's own frame

- **WHEN** an assembly states `elbow_pin.on(art3.hinge, Revolute())`, or
  `art3.art4.foot.on(elbow_pin, Revolute())`
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming the mate and saying the
  moving end is a frame declared by a directly declared child

#### Scenario: A fixed end on a moving child is refused

- **WHEN** an assembly declares children `link` and `cap`, `link` placed
  by a revolute mate, and states `cap.bottom.on(link.knee, Revolute())`
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming the mate and `link`, and
  saying `cap` would rest against `link`'s rest placement and not follow
  it

#### Scenario: A second mate on one child is refused

- **WHEN** an assembly states two mates whose moving ends are frames of
  the same child
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming both mates and saying a
  second mate on a placed child closes a loop

#### Scenario: A mate needs a revolute freedom

- **WHEN** an assembly states `art3.hinge.on(elbow_pin)`, or
  `art3.hinge.on(elbow_pin, Prismatic())`
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming the mate and saying which
  freedoms a mate accepts in this version

#### Scenario: A freedom states the line across its attachment frame

- **WHEN** a housing declares `shoulder_pin = Frame(at=(0, 0, 123))`,
  its child `art2` declares
  `bore = Frame(at=(0, 0, 68), z=(0, 1, 0), x=(-1, 0, 0))` — Thor's
  shoulder connector as the design states it, its `z` across the joint
  line — and the housing states
  `shoulder = art2.bore.on(shoulder_pin, Revolute(axis=(0, 0, 1),
  at=(0, 0, 0), unit='deg'))`
- **THEN** the class is created and reports one mate named `shoulder`,
  moving `art2.bore` onto `shoulder_pin`

#### Scenario: A freedom may state its anchor alone

- **WHEN** an assembly states
  `swing = part.hinge.on(pin, Revolute(at=(0, 0, 0)))`
- **THEN** the class is created, the line keeping the moving frame's `z`
  as its direction

#### Scenario: A stated line is numbers

- **WHEN** an assembly declaring `lift = Length(5)` states
  `part.hinge.on(pin, Revolute(at=(0, 0, lift)))`, or
  `part.hinge.on(pin, Revolute(axis=lambda node: (0, 0, 1)))`
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming the class, the mate and the
  argument, and saying a mate's stated line is written in the assembly
  and read in the moving child's frame, so it is three numbers

#### Scenario: A stated axis has a direction

- **WHEN** an assembly states
  `part.hinge.on(pin, Revolute(axis=(0, 0, 0)))`
- **THEN** creating the class raises, naming the class, the mate and
  `axis`, and saying an axis of zero length states no line

#### Scenario: A mate with a freedom has a name

- **WHEN** an assembly states `art3.hinge.on(elbow_pin, Revolute())`
  bare, without assigning it
- **THEN** creating the class raises, saying the mate's coordinate is
  named after the mate and asking for an assignment

#### Scenario: A list-held child cannot be mated

- **WHEN** an assembly declares `arms = [Arm(), Arm()]` and states a mate
  on a frame reached through `arms`
- **THEN** the statement is refused, naming the declaration and saying a
  list-held child is named one by one

### Requirement: A mate gives the moving child a joint

At realization the moving child SHALL move about a revolute joint whose
axis is the freedom's stated `axis`, or the moving frame's `z` when the
freedom states none, and whose anchor is the freedom's stated `at`, or
the moving frame's origin when the freedom states none — all in the
child's own rest frame, where the frame was declared and a stated line is
read, so nothing is carried or inverted — carrying the freedom's range
and unit. An `at` written as `(0, 0, 0)` SHALL be the child's own origin,
not the frame's. The frames SHALL fix the child's rest placement, and
therefore the zero of the coordinate, whatever line the freedom states;
the freedom SHALL fix only the line. Nothing SHALL check that a stated
line passes through the frames' common origin or lies along either
frame's `z`: an anchor is any point on its line, and the line is the
freedom's own.

A mate whose freedom states no line SHALL give the child exactly the
joint it gave before a freedom could state one. The joint SHALL behave as a class-declared joint of the
child in every respect: it SHALL be reported by the joint enumerator for
the class the child is realized as, under the mate's name, in a position
AFTER every joint the child's own class declares, and SHALL compose in
that position, outside the child's own freedoms and inside its rest
placement.

A child a mate moves SHALL keep its identity: it SHALL key the same
artifacts as the same child declared with no mate, and its class SHALL
report the declared class's name.

A mate whose name the moving child's class already answers to — a
parameter, a child, a port, a joint, a frame, a marking, a method or any
other attribute — SHALL be refused when the assembly's class is created,
naming the assembly, the mate, the child's class and what it already
declares.

#### Scenario: The elbow joint is the one Thor writes by hand

- **WHEN** the upper arm of "Thor's elbow is one statement" is realized
- **THEN** the forearm root's class reports a joint `elbow` with axis
  `(0, 1, 0)` and anchor `(0, 0, 81.5)`, and binding it to 30 places
  exactly the operations Thor's hand-declared `Revolute(axis=(0, 1, 0),
  at=(0, 0, 81.5))` places at 30

#### Scenario: Thor's shoulder turns about the line its freedom states

- **WHEN** the housing of "A freedom states the line across its
  attachment frame" is realized, and then bound with `shoulder` at 30
- **THEN** the upper arm's class reports a joint `shoulder` with axis
  `(0, 0, 1)` and anchor `(0, 0, 0)`; at rest the upper arm is turned
  180 degrees about `(0, 0.7071…, 0.7071…)` and translated by
  `(0, -68, 123)`, as Thor's hand-written `render()` places it; and at 30
  its operations are a turn of 30 about `(0, 0, 1)` with no centring
  pair, then that rest placement — the pose of the hand-placed arm
  jointed by `Revolute(axis=(0, 0, 1))` at 30

#### Scenario: Thor's wrist turns across its attachment frame

- **WHEN** an assembly declares `wrist_pin = Frame(at=(0, 0, 111.5))`
  and a child `art56` declaring `bore = Frame(x=(0, -1, 0))`, and states
  `wrist = art56.bore.on(wrist_pin, Revolute(axis=(1, 0, 0)))`, bound at
  30
- **THEN** the child rests turned 90 degrees about `(0, 0, 1)` and
  translated by `(0, 0, 111.5)`, and at 30 it turns 30 about `(1, 0, 0)`
  in its own frame inside that rest placement, as the hand-placed child
  jointed by `Revolute(axis=(1, 0, 0))` does

#### Scenario: A stated axis keeps the sign a reversed frame would flip

- **WHEN** an assembly declares `yaw_pin = Frame(at=(0, 0, -1))` and a
  child declaring `bore = Frame(z=(0, 0, -1))`, and states
  `yaw = child.bore.on(yaw_pin, Revolute(axis=(0, 0, 1)))`, bound at 30
- **THEN** the child's joint turns about `(0, 0, 1)`, not about the
  frame's `(0, 0, -1)`, and its pose at 30 is the hand-placed child's
  jointed by `Revolute(axis=(0, 0, 1))` at 30

#### Scenario: An anchor at the child's origin drops the centring pair

- **WHEN** Thor's shoulder is mated through a bore whose `z` is on the
  joint line, `bore = Frame(at=(0, 0, 68), z=(0, 0, 1), x=(0, 1, 0))`,
  once with `Revolute()` and once with `Revolute(at=(0, 0, 0))`, and
  each is bound at 30
- **THEN** the first joint's anchor is `(0, 0, 68)` and its operations
  carry the centring pair `∓(0, 0, 68)` around the turn, and the second
  joint's anchor is `(0, 0, 0)` and its operations are the turn alone,
  the two poses equal

#### Scenario: A mated wheel keeps its own spin inside the mate

- **WHEN** a wheel class declares `spin = Revolute(axis=(0, 0, 1))` and
  an assembly mates it with `steer = wheel.hub.on(knuckle, Revolute())`
- **THEN** the wheel's class reports `spin` then `steer`, and binding
  both applies `spin`'s operations innermost, then `steer`'s, then the
  mate's rest placement

#### Scenario: A mate cannot hide a child's attribute

- **WHEN** the forearm root's class already declares a joint `elbow` and
  the upper arm states `elbow = art3.hinge.on(elbow_pin, Revolute())`
- **THEN** creating the upper arm's class raises, naming the upper arm,
  the mate, the forearm root's class and its joint `elbow`

#### Scenario: A mated child keys its unmated artifacts

- **WHEN** a part is realized once as a mated child and once as an
  unmated child with the same arguments
- **THEN** both realized parts have the same identity

### Requirement: A mate publishes nothing new

A mated machine's published document SHALL carry the mate's compiled
rest placement as ordinary operations and its coordinate as an ordinary
binding, SHALL declare the document version a machine without mates
declares, and SHALL add no field. A machine that declares no frame and
no mate SHALL publish a document byte-identical to the one it published
before frames and mates existed, and a mated machine whose mates' freedoms
state no line SHALL publish a document byte-identical to the one it
published before a freedom could state one. A mate whose freedom states
its line SHALL publish that line only as the axis and anchor of the
joint's ordinary operations.

#### Scenario: A mated machine needs no newer consumer

- **WHEN** a mated version of Thor's elbow fixture is exported
- **THEN** the document declares the same version an unmated machine
  declares, and its forearm root's operations and bindings are those of
  the hand-written elbow

#### Scenario: A machine without mates is unchanged

- **WHEN** a fixture machine that declares no frame or mate is exported
  before and after this change
- **THEN** the two documents are byte-identical

#### Scenario: A mate that states no line is unchanged

- **WHEN** a mated fixture machine whose freedoms state no line is
  exported before and after a freedom could state one
- **THEN** the two documents are byte-identical
